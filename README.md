# getNextLine

We had to create a function that is able to read line by line a file descriptor. 

This function take a `file descriptor` which correspond to the file descriptor we want to read.

While compiling it takes in argument : `-d BUFFER_SIZE=X`. Replace X by the size you want greater than 0.

The function will return the line read or `NULL` if an error occured.
